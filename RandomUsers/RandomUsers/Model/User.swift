// Decodable is for get only
// Codable has Encodable and Decodable inside of it. Decodable takes information and puts it into a swift/Objective-C format
// Encodable takes Swift/Objective-C code and converts it into JSON
// First thing to do in a model is a struct
// Look at the resutls that are return by the ISP and see what type of data is on there
struct UserResult: Decodable {

	let results: [User]
}

struct User: Decodable {
	var name: Name // Name is not a string, but a dictionary
	var email: String
	var phone: String
}


// We need to make another struct for the name because we want to access the first name and it is nested inside the name, which is nested inside results
struct Name: Decodable { // Name is nested data in resutls in the JSON on the api
	var first: String
	var last: String


}
